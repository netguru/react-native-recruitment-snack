# React Native recruitment snack

This project is a recruitment task designed to be used within Expo Snack. It provides a simple example of a React Native weather app. The snack can be used to showcase React Native skills of the candidates during a recruitment process.

## Getting Started

### Quick start

To run this project in Expo Snack, follow these steps:
1. Open [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@git/github.com/netguru/react-native-recruitment-snack)
2. Rename it to have the next format `[Candidate Name and Surname] - Weather App Recruitment Task`
3. Press "Save" and keep the snack's link to share it with the candidate

### Import repository to empty snack (Optional) 

If you are creating the Expo Snack from scratch then you need to import the GitHub repository manually. I should do following instead of the [Quick Start](https://github.com/netguru/react-native-recruitment-snack?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) first step:
1. Click on the “Import Git Repository” button (press tree dots next to the 'Project' in the explorer bar first)
2. Enter the GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/netguru/react-native-recruitment-snack.git`
3. Click “Import” to load the project

Alternatively, you can copy the code from the sections below and paste it into a new Snack project.

## Known Issues

As Expo Snack runs in the browser, it has some limitations you should be aware of:

* **Hot Reloading:** Hot reloading does not work in Expo Snacks containing a bottom tab navigator. As a solution, we added an app refresh button. Candidates should press this button to see any changes made.
* **Library Support:** The choice of libraries is limited. You can’t use libraries that do not support Expo Snack.
* **HTTP/HTTPS Requests:** Sometimes Expo Snack rejects HTTP requests. To avoid it use HTTPS protocol for you requests
